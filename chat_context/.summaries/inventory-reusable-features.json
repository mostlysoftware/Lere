  "notes": "RunLog/Logging and Verify-FileChecksum are already implemented under scripts/lib. JDK installer logic and AutoFix/Policy live inside scripts/dev_setup.ps1 and scripts/health_check.ps1 respectively and would benefit from extraction to scripts/lib/*.ps1. Many callers reference logging helpers directly; refactor should provide compatibility shims or update all callers and keep backups."
