# Lere's Guardian Datapack (Phase 1)

Minimal scaffolding for development.

Contents:
- `pack.mcmeta` — datapack metadata (update `pack_format` to match your MC version if needed)
- `data/lere_guardian/advancements/quest_intro.json` — placeholder advancement that never triggers
- `data/lere_guardian/tags/biomes/shared_zones.json` — placeholder biome tag for shared zones concept

Notes:
- Files are placeholders to validate loading; replace with real data as features land.
- Keep additions small and link substantive changes in `changelog-context.md`.
