# Session Close — 2025-11-28 00:25

Priority: low

Summary:
Closed the implementation session. Implemented Windows CI build validation for plugin projects, added local build environment helpers, and extended `scripts/audit.ps1` with a non-blocking `-CheckBuild` option. Reconciled backups pointers and regenerated manifests during normalize runs.

Actions taken:
- Added `.github/workflows/build-plugins.yml` (Windows runner) to validate `plugins/lere_core` and `plugins/lere_multiplayer` builds; workflow prefers Gradle wrapper and falls back to Chocolatey-installed Gradle.
- Added `scripts/check_build_env.ps1` to detect Java/Gradle and provide installation advice.
- Added `scripts/setup_gradle_wrapper.ps1` to generate Gradle wrapper files locally (recommended to commit wrapper files).
- Updated `scripts/audit.ps1` with `-CheckBuild` (non-blocking) to run local builds and report results.
- Reconciled `chat_context/backups` pointers; regenerated manifests (manifest-*.json) during normalization.

Files changed/added:
- `.github/workflows/build-plugins.yml`
- `scripts/check_build_env.ps1`
- `scripts/setup_gradle_wrapper.ps1`
- `scripts/audit.ps1` (added -CheckBuild)

Next steps:
- Optionally generate and commit the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/*`) by running `.	ools\setup_gradle_wrapper.ps1` on a machine with Gradle and committing the files.
- Add Pester unit tests and roundtrip restore tests for `prune_sessions.ps1` and `audit.ps1` in CI.
